; NSIS installer for Hydra Download Manager on Windows.
;
; Compile from THIS directory (paths below are relative to it):
;
;   makensis -DARCH=x64   hydra-installer.nsi
;   makensis -DARCH=arm64 hydra-installer.nsi
;   makensis -DVERSION=0.3.0 -DBUILD_DIR=..\..\target\custom\release hydra-installer.nsi
;
; Expects hydra-gui.exe, hydra-host.exe, and hydra.exe already built in
; BUILD_DIR (default: target\<rust-triple>\release for the chosen ARCH), and
; the browser extensions packed into target\extensions by
; scripts/build-extensions.sh.
; Cross-build from macOS with scripts/build-windows-installer.sh, or
; natively with `cargo build --release -p hya-gui -p hya-host -p hya-cli`.
;
; Installs per-user (no elevation), mirroring scripts/install-native-host.ps1:
;   * Hydra Download Manager  - the GUI app + logo + shortcuts
;   * IPC host                - hydra-host.exe, native-messaging manifests,
;                               and the HKCU registry keys the browsers read
;   * CLI (hydra.exe + the   - with $INSTDIR appended to the user PATH so
;     hya.exe short name)      all binaries resolve in cmd/PowerShell
;   * Browser extensions      - packed .zip/.xpi + unpacked chrome/ and
;                               firefox/, with INSTALL.txt instructions
;
; Silent install (Chocolatey, winget, scripted deployments):
;
;   hydra-<ver>-windows-x64-setup.exe /S [/NODESKTOP] [/D=C:\path]
;
; Every section that is selected by default runs, so a silent install gets
; the same Start-menu AND desktop shortcuts as clicking through the wizard;
; /NODESKTOP drops the desktop shortcut. Chocolatey runs the installer
; elevated, and a per-user install lands in the profile of the account that
; elevated - the shortcuts (and the app) show up for that account.
;
; Windows has no NativeMessagingHosts directory: each browser reads a
; registry value pointing at a manifest file. Chromium browsers key it by
; extension origin, Firefox by add-on id, so two manifests are written. The
; host is only the FALLBACK transport (and the only thing that can start
; Hydra when it is not running) - day to day the extension talks to the app
; over ws://127.0.0.1:6799, which needs no registration at all.
