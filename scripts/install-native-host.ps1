# Windows has no NativeMessagingHosts directory: each browser reads a
# registry value that points at the manifest file. Chromium browsers key it
# by extension origin, Firefox by add-on id, so two manifest files are
# written under %APPDATA%\hydra — the same files, in the same place, that
# the packaged app writes on every launch, so the two never disagree.
#
# The host is only the FALLBACK transport (and the only thing that can start
# Hydra when it is not running) — day to day the extension talks to the app
# over ws://127.0.0.1:6799, which needs no registration at all.
