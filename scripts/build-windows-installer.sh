# `amd64` is accepted as an alias for x64 (same x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

#
# Needs: cargo-xwin, Homebrew LLVM (lld-link), makensis (brew install makensis),
# and python3 (or python) for packing the browser extensions.
#
# --cross-compiler clang (not the clang-cl default) is required: ring's
# build.rs force-switches to plain clang on windows-aarch64, which rejects
# the /imsvc flags clang-cl emits. .cargo/config.toml already pins
# +crt-static so the exes need no VC++ Redistributable on the target.
