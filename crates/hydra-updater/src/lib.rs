//! Hydra self-update: release check, asset download, archive extraction and
//! the swap-in-place step.
//!
//! One library serves three callers:
//! - **hydra-gui** — startup check, the update dialog's download-with-progress,
//!   extraction, and launching the finisher binary.
//! - **hydra** (CLI) — `hydra update`, which only reports the newer version
//!   and the download link.
//! - **hydra-updater** (this crate's own bin) — the finisher that runs after
//!   the app exits and copies the new files into place.
//!
//! The release endpoint defaults to the real GitHub API but is overridable via
//! the `HYDRA_UPDATE_API` environment variable, which is how the whole flow is
//! exercised against a local mock server (see `examples/mock_server.rs` and
//! `tests/mock_flow.rs`) before it is pointed at production releases.
