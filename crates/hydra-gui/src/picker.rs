//! Native file and folder panels that leave the event loop running.
//!
//! `rfd`'s blocking API shows the panel on the calling thread and runs the
//! platform's own modal loop there. Called from `update`, that loop owns the
//! thread every window message arrives on for as long as the user browses:
//! the app stops repainting, and on Windows the panel then has to share its
//! message pump with the redraw traffic of every running transfer — which is
//! what made browsing for a save folder crawl while a download was live.
//!
//! The async API hands the panel to the platform instead: a thread of its own
//! on Windows, a sheet on macOS, the portal on Linux. It has one rule — the
//! panel must be *built* on the main thread, because AppKit begins the sheet
//! in the constructor rather than at first poll, which is why handing the
//! whole call to an executor thread deadlocks. So every panel here is built
//! inside `window::run`, which runs its closure on the event loop, and only
//! the future it returns is awaited off it.
//!
//! Building it there also gives the panel its owner window, which is what
//! keeps it in front of the window that asked for it now that that window is
//! no longer frozen behind it.
