//! RFC 6265 cookie storage, owned by one transfer.
//!
//! A [`CookieJar`] is consulted once per request head and updated from every
//! `Set-Cookie` the server answers with. That is all it takes to make a
//! login-gated redirect chain work: the first hop hands out a session cookie,
//! the jar stores it, and the hop that follows carries it back — which is the
//! case a bare `-H 'Cookie: …'` cannot express, because the header is fixed
//! before the chain starts.
//!
//! # The security boundary
//!
//! **A cookie never crosses an origin.** [`CookieJar::header_value`] selects by
//! the host of the request about to be sent, so a redirect from `evil.test` to
//! `bank.test` carries `bank.test`'s cookies and nothing else — there is no
//! path through this module by which a cookie set on one host reaches another.
//! That is structural rather than a check: the selector takes the destination
//! host as its argument and has no memory of where the chain has been.
//!
//! Two narrower rules hold the rest of the boundary:
//!
//! * A `Domain` attribute may only widen a cookie to a domain the setting host
//!   is itself under, and never to a [public suffix](is_public_suffix) — so
//!   `Set-Cookie: …; Domain=.co.uk` from `shop.co.uk` is dropped rather than
//!   handed to every other `.co.uk`.
//! * A `Secure` cookie is withheld from a plaintext request.
//!
//! The jar is per job. Two downloads running at once against different hosts
//! hold separate jars, so neither can observe the other's session.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! `SameSite` is accepted and discarded rather than stored. Every request a
//! downloader makes is a top-level navigation to the URL the user named, so no
//! value of the attribute would change which cookies are sent; and the
//! Netscape interchange format has no column to write it back to. A field
//! nothing reads and nothing can persist is weight, not preservation.
//!
//! `HttpOnly` is stored, because [`netscape`] round-trips it and other tools
//! read it — but it does not gate anything here either. It bars scripts, and
//! this is not one.
