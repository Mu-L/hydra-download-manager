/// like when the transfer is long enough for the connections to overlap. Sampling
/// `/proc/<pid>/task/*` mid-transfer showed 11 live worker threads under a 4-worker
/// runtime, with thread ids changing between samples — the blocking pool churning.

/// A downloader opens many connections to ONE host by construction, so the second
