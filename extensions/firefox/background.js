// Hydra browser integration, Firefox event page. Everything browser-neutral
// is core.js (a copy of extensions/chrome/core.js, loaded before this file
// by the manifest); this file is only the Gecko way of capturing a download.
//
// Gecko cannot park a download. `downloads.pause()` there is
// `download.cancel()`, and `downloads.resume()` is gated on `canResume`,
// which needs `hasPartialData` — false for a download still at byte 0. So a
// download touched on creation and handed back would stay "Canceled" for
// good, and one cancelled after Hydra took it leaves a "Canceled" row in the
// Library that `downloads.erase()` does not remove: erase drops the session
// entry, not the history one.
//
// So the decision is made one step earlier, in a blocking
// `webRequest.onHeadersReceived`, before a download exists at all. A
// response cancelled there leaves nothing behind: no bytes past the headers,
// no row. Firefox holds the response for as long as the answer takes, so a
// closed app can be launched by the native host and still take the file
// before the browser has written a byte of it. `downloads.onCreated` stays
// registered underneath as the net for a transfer that never passed through
// a response we were shown, and pays the cancelled row for it.

// The two capture paths, each standing the other down, in the one direction it
// can arrive from.
//
// A response judged at the header stage and declined, waiting for the download
// the browser is about to make of it. Read once, then forgotten: clicking the
// same link again is a new question. (`browserOwned`, the other direction, is
// core.js's: the Alt bypass sets it from there.)
